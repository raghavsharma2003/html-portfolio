-- Meera's database (Neon Postgres, reached over SQL-over-HTTP by api/_db.js).
--
-- Every one of these tables was created ad hoc from a throwaway script, which
-- meant the schema existed in exactly one place: the running database. Nothing
-- in the repo described it, so a fresh deploy could not rebuild it and nobody
-- reviewing a query could check it against anything. This file is that record,
-- transcribed from the live database rather than from memory, so it matches
-- what is actually running.
--
-- It is idempotent — safe to run against the live database or an empty one.
--
--   node -e "const {q}=await import('./api/_db.js'); ..."  (see scratchpad)
--
-- DEVICE ID IS THE IDENTITY. Every user-scoped table is keyed by device_id and
-- every statement that touches user data filters on it. That is what makes
-- "you can only ever delete your own rows" true by construction rather than by
-- remembering to check.

-- Her audit trail: what actually happened during a call, in order. Written
-- fail-soft (api/diag.js returns 200 even when the insert fails) because
-- diagnostics must never break the product — which is why it is worth probing
-- deliberately, since nothing else will ever report it broken.

-- The one thing a forget does NOT delete: the word itself.
--
-- The extractor reads the last ~16 turns off the CLIENT, not off meera_log, so
-- a thing deleted last turn is still sitting in the transcript on their screen,
-- ready to be learned again on the next pass. Deleting rows and stopping there
-- buys exactly one turn of forgetting. This table is what makes it stick: the
-- extractor filters against it BEFORE the upsert, checking name AND summary,
-- because a term filtered out of the name walks back in through the summary.
--
-- It is not a tombstone. The memory row is genuinely gone — there is no
-- deleted_at anywhere in this schema, so there is nothing for recall to filter
-- and no way for a later change to get the filtering wrong. This table holds
-- the term and nothing else, is never read by recall, never enters a prompt,
-- and is itself deleted by a full wipe.

-- ── Supabase storage (a separate database; recorded here so the whole picture
--    lives in one file) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Photos live in the `meera-photos` bucket under `${device}/${epochMs}-rand.jpg`.
-- The timestamp travels in the filename, which is what lets a windowed forget
-- honour its own window instead of falling back to all-or-nothing.
--
-- The bucket had anon policies for INSERT and SELECT but none for DELETE, so
-- every delete returned 200 with an empty array and removed nothing: forgetting
-- cleared the rows describing a photo and left the photo in storage. Applied as
-- migration meera_photos_anon_delete:
--
--   create policy meera_photos_anon_delete on storage.objects for delete
--     to anon using (bucket_id = 'meera-photos');
--
-- Scoped to this bucket. The anon key is held server-side by api/memory.js and
-- does not appear in the shipped client bundle (verified: it contains no JWT of
-- any kind), so this grants deletion to our proxy and not to users.

-- Web lookup cache, keyed by the normalised query.
